# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## My Goals:
* code everyday
* continue learning Python + Django: My wife and I like cooking, but we have descentralization of recipes. I'll try to develop a platform like https://cookpad.com/es in Django + Python + REST, making some improvements in the database to have the possibility to analyze the information.

### Resources:

#### Python:
I have a few books and courses and would like to use them:
1. [Python Data Science Handbook: Essential Tools for Working with Data](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential/dp/1491912057/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1RH3QBDHK6Y2D&keywords=python+data+science+handbook&qid=1566929081&s=gateway&sprefix=python+data%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-1) With this book I learned to work with NumPy library.
2. [Python & Django + REST Course](https://plataforma.keepcoding.io/p/curso-online-python-django-rest) This course was my first contact with Django and I loved it.

### Day 0: August 27, 2019
##### Preparing 100DaysOfCode repo

**Today's Progress**: Forked 100daysOfcode repository. Update my goals. Create repository for my project. Create project with PyCharm, install Django in a virtual envirnoment and push changes to project's GitHub repository.

**Thoughts:** What I see more complicated is the front-end part, in the back-end I usually manage to solve problems better or worse.

### Day 1: August 28, 2019
##### Preparing the database's EER diagram 

**Today's Progress**: I have tried several EER diagram editors for Mac OS, I have finally made the diagram with MySqlWorkbench and I have attached it to the project. I connected my Django application with new database in PostgreSQL and I deleted default database in SQLlite.

**Thoughts:** I hope has a large volume of data, I discarded SqlLite databasa and I'm using PostgreSQL in localhost. I would have liked to make the models in python, but connecting to the new database in PostgreSQL has taken me more time than expected.
